# Portfolio Web Site

My portfolio site built with Astro, using SpectreCSS and SASS for styling.

## Usage

Astro makes everything plug and play.

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Will start the dev server and compile site and show it in the browser.

If you want to see what the compiled CSS looks like without building the whole project, use:

```bash
$ npm run compile-sass
```

To build the project use:

```bash
$ npm run build
```

This list is semi-ordered

## To do list
- [ ] Get two column layout into a component
- [ ] Get nav button styled properly (vertical rail and icons, place at bottom right of screen)
- [ ] Get fixed nav rail at small screen sizes
- [ ] Do the timeline component
- [ ] Get placeholders in for the blog and projects sections
- [ ] Work out where we are putting the social buttons (Top right?)
- [ ] VIEW TRANSITIONS

### Nice to haves
- [ ] Look at how easy it is to add analytics for free
- [ ] Look at implementing a contact me section
